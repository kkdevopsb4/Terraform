# Terraform `for_each` Meta-Argument – AWS Deep Dive (with IAM User Example)

The `for_each` meta-argument in Terraform allows you to create **multiple uniquely managed resources** from a map or set.

---

## 🔹 What is `for_each`?

`for_each` is used when:
- You want to **create multiple resources** with unique names or values
- You want **fine-grained control** over individual resources
- You are working with **maps or sets of strings**

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "dev_users" {
  for_each = toset(["alice", "bob", "charlie"])
  name     = each.key
}
````

Creates 3 IAM users: `alice`, `bob`, and `charlie`.

---

## 🔹 Accessing Values in `for_each`

* `each.key` – refers to the key (or the value itself if using a set)
* `each.value` – refers to the value (only in maps)

---

## 🔹 Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ 1. Create IAM Users from a Set

```hcl
variable "usernames" {
  default = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "team_users" {
  for_each = toset(var.usernames)
  name     = each.key

  tags = {
    Team      = "DevOps"
    CreatedBy = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

Creates 3 IAM users with the tag `Team = DevOps`.

---

### ✅ 2. IAM Users with Different Tags (using Map)

```hcl
variable "user_map" {
  default = {
    alice   = "dev"
    bob     = "qa"
    charlie = "infra"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "department_users" {
  for_each = var.user_map
  name     = each.key

  tags = {
    Department = each.value
    CreatedBy  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

Creates:

* alice (dev),
* bob (qa),
* charlie (infra) IAM users with department tags.

---

### ✅ 3. IAM Policy Attachment per User

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "attach_policy" {
  for_each = toset(["alice", "bob"])

  user       = each.key
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
}
```

Attaches the S3 read-only policy to alice and bob.

---

## 🔹 `for_each` with Modules

```hcl
module "iam_user" {
  source = "./modules/iam_user"
  for_each = var.user_map

  user_name   = each.key
  department  = each.value
}
```

Use this for DRY and scalable design.

---

## 🔹 Best Practices

* Use `toset()` for lists to ensure uniqueness
* Use `for_each` when deleting/updating individual resources matters
* Avoid using `count` when managing unique names (use `for_each` instead)

---

## ⚠️ Common Errors

| Error                       | Reason                    | Solution                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Invalid for_each argument` | Used list with duplicates | Use `toset()`                         |
| `Each key must be string`   | Used unsupported type     | Ensure input is map or set of strings |
| `Missing each.key`          | Wrong block reference     | Use `each.key` inside block           |

---

## 🔁 Comparison: `for_each` vs `count`

| Feature       | `count`                 | `for_each`               |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Input         | Number, list            | Map, Set                 |
| Access        | `count.index`           | `each.key`, `each.value` |
| Resource Mgmt | Based on index          | Based on named key       |
| Use When      | Same resources          | Unique, named resources  |
| Delete Safety | Less safe (index shift) | Safer, can delete by key |

---

## 📌 Summary

* `for_each` is best for uniquely identifiable resources like IAM users, S3 buckets, etc.
* Helps in writing modular, cleaner, and scalable Terraform code
* Always use **maps or sets** as input types

---

## 🧩 Real-Time Tip

Use `terraform plan` to verify how many resources are being created and named.

```bash
terraform plan
```

It helps in confirming that `for_each` is iterating correctly.

---

> ✅ Use `for_each` for uniquely named resources like IAM users. It's more readable, scalable, and safer than `count` when managing individual resources.
